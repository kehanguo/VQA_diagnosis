# sprint4
In sprint3, we examined Saliency map method, in which the brightness of a pixel represents how salient the pixel is.This method are very useful to deal with big image where ony a small part is needed predict the output. In our proposal, we are dealing with medical image(especially radiology images), this saliency map ideally will serve pretty good to extract features from region of interest, and we are still exploring its application in medical image field. Maybe in the later, we could implement this model with our current one.
