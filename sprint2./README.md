##  Image classification

Here we implemented a simple transfer learning model to classify ants and bees. The training set has been properly cut. We have nearly 120 images in total for traning, and 75 images for validation. This test could be run in CPU easily, and takes about 25 minutes overall. The reason we choose to run this model is to better understand how image is processed in convulutional neural network. It is simply a tutorial for us to get familiar with torch. And the result is showed below:
